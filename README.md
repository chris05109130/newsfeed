News Feed Project:

Description:

This site is another one of my API projects I made that basically just a main page on a newsfeed project. I used typicode API for all the information used on this site. 
On this page there is the top ten user list, you could write a post, followed by a list of post already made, followed by a recent comment list as well. Everything is just information from the API so I can show that I know how to make calls and display the information back to the webpage.
